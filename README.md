# Gemini-AI-assistant-integration #
This is a repository, which conntains all the code you will need to integrate an elegant chatbot into anything you make. It has been written in the `.tsx` language, originally for a *Framer* site. This code has been written by Jules *(an experiment by **Google**)*. This is what it does-
1) Firstly, it asks the user's name, and his/her gender.
2) Then, the page changes, revealing a page where in the text box, you type your query, and it answers.

It's as simple as that! The assistant sometimes adresses the user by name (which was entered at the beginning) when it is prudent to do so. This has been entirely written by AI *(Jules made it originally, while GitHub Copilot fixed the issues)*. Also, as this has been entirely made by AI, pull requests will be very much useful. If you want to beautify it, make it more elegant, improve its usability, or anything else, then please do submit one!
How to use it?
1) Enter your own API key in this block of code-```tsx
// IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual API key
const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
   ```
