# Gemini-AI-assistant-integration 🤖✨

Welcome to the magical land of chatbot integration, where AI does the heavy lifting and you pretend it was hard. This repo is your golden ticket to slapping a sleek chatbot into whatever Frankenstein project you're cobbling together. Written in `.tsx` (because obviously), and originally summoned for a *Framer* site.

Created by Jules — an experiment by **Google** — and debugged by GitHub Copilot (who still hasn’t unionized 🪧). Here's what this glorious mess does:

1. 🕵️‍♂️ Asks the user's name and gender. Because personalization is the illusion of caring.
2. 🧙‍♀️ Magically transforms the page to reveal a text box where you type your deepest questions and get answers. Or vague AI ramblings. Same thing.

Yep, that’s it. No rocket science. The assistant might even call you by name if it’s feeling generous.

This was entirely written by AI — Jules started it, Copilot patched it, and now it’s your circus 🎪. Pull requests are welcome, especially if you want to:

* 💅 Make it prettier (because aesthetics matter)
* 🧼 Improve usability (so your users don’t cry)
* 🧪 Break it in new and exciting ways (chaos is innovation)

## How to Use It 🛠️

1. Paste your own API key into this sacred block of code (don’t forget to actually replace it, genius):

```tsx
// IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual API key
const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```
- Integrate it into your project and start chatting away like it’s 2049. Bonus points if you pretend it’s sentient! 🤖
